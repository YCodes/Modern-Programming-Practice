The equals method is returning false for p1.equals(p2) because the object p2 is not the instance of the class PersonWithJob
 so the overridden equals method in same class returns false when its check for the class of both objects.

While p2.equals(p1) returns true because the p1 is the referred as the instance of person during compile time although 
it refers to PersonWithJob class and object p1 is inherited.
